		<h2>Summary of Me:</h2>
		<p>
			My Name is Brady Murren and I am from East Berlin, Pennsylvania.
			After graduating high school I came to the Rochester Institute of
			Technology to study Software Engineering with a minor/focus in 
			Game Design and Development.  I have not yet started my minor,
			seeing as I am a 2nd year, however my main goal for after graduation
			is to get a job as a game designer or app developer. 
		</p>
		
		<h2>Site Mission:</h2>
		<p>
			Although true that this site is merely an assignment
			for class, its general purpose is to show off my technical
			skills with html5 (at least what I have learned so far in 
			class) and organize my professional information in website
			format.
